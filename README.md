# Categorical-Feature-Encoding

This repo contains implementation for Categorical Feature Encoding.
This is a sample implementation done for the Kaggle challenge "categorical feature encoding" for one of the courses in my Uni.
So for the evaluation purpose I have used a smaller dataset. But you can use this for the entire dataset and the dataset can be directly downloaded from the Kaggle challenge link.

This is implemented with One hot encoding and a simple deep neural network to predict the binary target.
